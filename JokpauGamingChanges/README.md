# MicroSat_0.35m_Probe_Parts

This is an aeroplane launched rocket containing a 0.35m Satellite that I 
designed for uses such as a Remote Tech communications sat, Temperature 
Scan sat and what I like to refer to as a Contractual Obligation Sat (the 
"put a satellite in this orbit" contracts)

I was inspired by the Boeing/DARPA venture to do exactly this, as well 
as the brillaint and tiny CubeSats.
